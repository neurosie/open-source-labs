## Why is it important to choose a license?
A license is a legal contract defining how a piece of software can be used, changed, and shared. If you want others to be able to freely use your project, a license is the only way to guarantee that power.

## Why is it important that you shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
Not having a license does not automatically make a project open source or public domain. Without a license granting the rights to modify and distribute, those rights are maintained by the author. Using a project without an explicit license can lead to legal problems.
